**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Marie-Hélène Burle

**Duration**: 3 * 120 minutes (total 6 hours)

**Description**:
R is a free and open-source programming language for
statistical computing, modelling, and graphics, with
a large collection of packages and a great community.
It is extremely popular in many academic fields, including the humanities.

This introductory course will get you started in a
friendly, non-intimidating atmosphere over 3 days.
We will cover the basics of the language, learn how to write functions,
use the popular packages from the tidyverse, and plot and analyse data.
By the end of the workshop, you should be self-sufficient
and able to use and keep learning R by yourself.
