**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Alex Razoumov

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: 3D visualization has been used in traditional scientific computing for the past several
decades to visualize the results of multidimensional numerical simulations. In humanities, 3D visualizations
have been mostly restricted to specialized areas such as game engines, architectural renderings, virtual
environments, photogrammetric processing, and visualization of point cloud data. In this short course I will
use the 3D space to visualize differences in vocabularies in a given set of texts as 3D scatter plots and 3D
graphs — think of this as an extension of traditional 2D plotting to the third dimension, where now you can
suddenly visualize much bigger datasets. This lecture-style course will have many live demos that you can try
running on your own computer after the course.
