**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Erin Clary, Tristan Kuehn, Meghan Goodchild and Neha Milan

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: This session will provide an overview of three nationally-supported Research Data Management
(RDM) Platforms and Services, the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR); Borealis, the Canadian Dataverse
Repository; and Lunaris, Canada’s national data discovery service. FRDR is a bilingual publishing platform for
sharing and preserving Canadian research data in any discipline. The repository is purpose-built for large
datasets and provides a curation service to assist researchers with deposit. Borealis is a bilingual,
multidisciplinary, Canadian research data repository, supported by academic libraries and research
institutions across Canada. Borealis supports open discovery, management, sharing, and preservation of
Canadian research data via institutionally-hosted and supported collections and contains national collections
such as Odesi, a curated, Canadian social science data repository and online exploration and analysis
tool. Lunaris harvests metadata from over 100 academic, government, and research data repositories across
Canada, and makes their content discoverable in a central platform that allows combined text- and map-based
search. Participants will leave this session with an understanding of how each platform can be used to support
the research lifecycle.

Please stay on for the next 30-minute session to hear more about Odesi!
