**February 13, 2024, 3:00-4:00 pm EST**

**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Erin Clary, Tristan Kuehn, Meghan Goodchild and Neha Milan

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: This session will provide an overview of three nationally-supported Research Data Management
(RDM) Platforms and Services, the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR); Borealis, the Canadian Dataverse
Repository; and Lunaris, Canada’s national data discovery service.

* [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/) is a bilingual publishing platform for
sharing and preserving Canadian research data in any discipline. The repository is purpose-built for large
datasets and provides a curation service to assist researchers with deposit.
* [Borealis](https://borealisdata.ca/) is a bilingual,
multidisciplinary, Canadian research data repository, supported by academic libraries and research
institutions across Canada. Borealis supports open discovery, management, sharing, and preservation of
Canadian research data via institutionally-hosted and supported collections and contains national collections
such as Odesi, a curated, Canadian social science data repository and online exploration and analysis
tool.
* [Lunaris](https://www.lunaris.ca/) harvests metadata from over 100 academic, government, and research data repositories across
Canada, and makes their content discoverable in a central platform that allows combined text- and map-based
search.

Participants will leave this session with an understanding
of how each platform can be used to support the research lifecycle.

Please stay on for the next 30-minute session to hear more about [Odesi](/odesi/)!
