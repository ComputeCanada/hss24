**Presented by**: Elie Haber

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: Using a single environment for all stages of your research project can help you organize your
work. To this end, our team recommends JupyterLab, a software that logs code, text, equations, graphs and
visualizations in a single document. This tool can also execute the lines of a program one at a time and thus
allow their respective effects to be accurately identified. This training will equip you to take advantage of
JupyterLab's graphical interface and its key features.
