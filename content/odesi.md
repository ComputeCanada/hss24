**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Description**: Odesi (https://odesi.ca) is an open, Canadian social science data repository and online
exploration and analysis tool. Odesi hosts over 5,700 datasets, curated and preserved by academic libraries in
Canada. Odesi contains Canadian public opinion polls, Statistics Canada public use microdata, aggregate data,
licensed data, census data, and more. In October 2023, Odesi’s backend repository officially migrated to
Borealis, the Canadian Dataverse Repository, with new connected tools to support deposit, curation, reuse,
searching, exploration, and analysis. Odesi allows researchers to search for survey questions (variables)
across thousands of datasets, supporting rich discovery and basic tabulation and analysis online. In this
session we will provide an overview of Odesi and available features, highlighting ways researchers can search,
explore, and reuse data in the collections.
