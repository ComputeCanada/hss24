**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Alex Razoumov

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: In this short session, we will demo some of Python's capabilities to researchers new to the
language, starting with multiple ways to run Python, high-level data collections such as lists and
dictionaries, using Python for data processing and manipulation, and data visualization. This short
lecture-style course will be followed by a separate, full-day interactive Python workshop in which we will
thoroughly study all these topics through hands-on exercises. This follow-up workshop will occur in the weeks
after the 2024 HSS Winter Series.
