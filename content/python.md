**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Alex Razoumov

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: In this short session, we will demo some of Python's capabilities to researchers new to the
language, starting with multiple ways to run Python, high-level data collections such as lists and
dictionaries, using Python for data processing and manipulation, and data visualization. This short
lecture-style course will be followed by a separate, full-day interactive Python workshop in which we will
thoroughly study all these topics through hands-on exercises. This follow-up workshop will occur in the weeks
after the 2024 HSS Winter Series.

#### Biography

**Alex Razoumov** earned his PhD in computational astrophysics
from the University of British Columbia and held postdoctoral
positions in Urbanaâ€“Champaign, San Diego, Oak Ridge, and Halifax.
He has worked on numerical models ranging from galaxy formation to
core-collapse supernovae and stellar hydrodynamics, and has developed a number
of computational fluid dynamics and radiative transfer codes and techniques.
He spent five years as HPC Analyst in SHARCNET helping
researchers from diverse backgrounds to use large clusters, and in
2014 moved back to Vancouver to focus on scientific visualization
and training researchers to use advanced computing tools.
He is now with Simon Fraser University.
