**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Joey Takeda

**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Description**: This workshop will introduce the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI): the de facto standard in the
humanities for creating digital texts. In this workshop, we will discuss the scholarly and technical
affordances are of using the TEI, answering why it is that so many digital humanities resources—including
Early English Books Online (EEBO), Eighteenth Century Collections Online, and the Women Writers Project—use
TEI to enrich their digital archives. We will also discuss the wide variety of tools and platforms built by
the TEI community for creating, sustaining, and publishing TEI encoded texts. No prior experience with markup
languages, text encoding, or the digital humanities necessary.
