**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Marie H. Burle

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: How does deep learning really work? What exactly are those large language models everybody

This presentation will answer these questions in a non-technical manner to give you a high-level understanding
of a discipline that has become crucial in all fields of research.

The goals are to:
- clarify concepts,
- present a range of tools available,
- give an overview of the field, and
- point out resources to get you started using DL, LLMs, or NLP for your research.
