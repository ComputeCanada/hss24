**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: Are you interested in sharing your work and connecting with other academic or non-academic
researchers using a free, open platform that combines features of social networking sites and institutional
repositories? Join us for this live introduction and demo, where participants will learn how to establish a
professional profile, build community, and develop and mobilize knowledge using the Canadian HSS Commons
(https://hsscommons.ca) — an in-development, national-scale network designed and built for the linguistically,
geographically, and culturally diverse community of HSS researchers in Canada. This event will take place in
English, but slides translated into French will also be available.
