**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Julie Faure-Lacroix

**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Description**: Need to create a map, but don't know how? Have you been asked to analyze geospatial data and
you are wondering where to start? This introduction is for you. We will use QGIS to explore the world of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and familiarize ourselves with the different steps of creating a simple
map. We will perform some basic operations and we will discover the open data available within QGIS and

#### Biography

**Julie Faure-Lacroix** has a bachelor’s degree and a
master’s degree in biology from Laval University, but she
started working for Calcul Québec while working on her Ph.D.
As a scientific liaison agent, her job is to reach out to academic researchers
to show them how high-powered computing can help them in their research.
The mandate of Calcul Québec and the Digital Research Alliance of Canada is to
lead the acceleration of research and innovation by deploying state-of-the-art
advanced research computing (ARC) systems, storage and software solutions, and
to give free access to its resources to all academic members across Canada.
She works on a variety of projects that range from
statistical models in R to geospatial analyses in ArcGIS.
Her focus is to predict the needs of the researchers and to make
the required software available before it is even requested.
She reaches out to potential users and guides them through their first
steps on the Alliance’s servers regardless of the user’s experience.
She is a recipient of the former Computer Canada Award for
Outstanding Achievement and she recently won an AnitaB Pass it on award.
