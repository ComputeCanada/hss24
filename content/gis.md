**Description**: Need to create a map, but don't know how? Have you been asked to analyze geospatial data and
you are wondering where to start? This introduction is for you. We will use QGIS to explore the world of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and familiarize ourselves with the different steps of creating a simple
map. We will perform some basic operations and we will discover the open data available within QGIS and
elsewhere on the web.
