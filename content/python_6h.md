**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Alex Razoumov

**Duration**: 3 * 120 minutes (total 6 hours)

**Description**:
Python can be used in many humanities and social sciences
workflows, and it is an easy and fun language to learn.
This introductory 3-day, 6-hour course will walk you through the basics
of programming in Python starting at the beginner's level. We will cover
the main language features – variables and data types, conditionals, lists,
for/while loops, list comprehensions, dictionaries, writing functions,
and working with external libraries, doing many exercises along the way.
In the second part we will take a look at some of the libraries
in more details, including pandas for working with large
tables, simple plotting with matplotlib, and few others.

#### Biography

**Alex Razoumov** earned his PhD in computational astrophysics
from the University of British Columbia and held postdoctoral
positions in Urbana–Champaign, San Diego, Oak Ridge, and Halifax.
He has worked on numerical models ranging from galaxy formation to
core-collapse supernovae and stellar hydrodynamics, and has developed a number
of computational fluid dynamics and radiative transfer codes and techniques.
He spent five years as HPC Analyst in SHARCNET helping
researchers from diverse backgrounds to use large clusters, and in
2014 moved back to Vancouver to focus on scientific visualization
and training researchers to use advanced computing tools.
He is now with Simon Fraser University.
