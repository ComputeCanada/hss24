**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: John Simpson

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**:
This 60 minute keynote presentation will
be divided into three, roughly equal, parts.
The first will share how the Humanities and Social Sciences National
Support Team with the Digital Research Alliance of Canada began, key
challenges that were faced, and approaches taken to overcoming them.
Skipping the present state, the second part will suggest
directions that support for Digital Humanities and Social
Sciences should consider as it moves to the future.
The third section will be open to questions from the audience
on the topic of supporting Digital Humanities and Social
Sciences in either the past (then) or the future (then).
Questions about the present (now) will also be welcome.
