**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Marie-Hélène Burle

**Duration**: 60 minutes

**Description**: R is a free and open-source programming language with a large collection of packages for
statistical computing, modeling, and graphics. It is extremely popular in several academic fields including
data mining, data analysis, and linguistics.

This presentation will give you a sense of what R can be used for through a series of examples (data
visualization, web scraping, and GIS). I will also talk about the strengths and weaknesses of R and who would
benefit most from learning it.

This high-level introduction will be followed by a hands-on workshop to get you started in R the week after
the HSS Series.
