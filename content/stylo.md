**Welcome by**: 

**Presented by**: Guilia Ferretti and Roch Delannay

**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Description**: We'll be presenting the main features of Stylo, a web-accessible semantic text editor for
writing in the humanities and social sciences. Since the project's launch in 2017, one of its objectives has
been to provide a tool capable of changing and improving the academic publishing chain, particularly the
workflow of journals in the humanities and social sciences.

Stylo is based on a principle known as single source publishing: from a single source Stylo can produce
different objects in various formats such as HTML, PDF, XML. The implementation of this principle relies first
and foremost on a WYSIWYM (What you see is what you mean) interface and the use of three formats to manipulate
the source: Markdown for body text, YAML to serialize metadata and BibTeX to structure bibliographic
references.

In this workshop, we'll show how to create and write text in Stylo, as well as the various functions for
manipulating the elements that will form the source of our documents, which we can then export in a variety of
formats.
